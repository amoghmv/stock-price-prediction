- **Apple stock is heavily influenced by iPhones than Mac and iPad developments**

**During this year (2022), Apple launched the iPhone SE 3rd Generation and the iPhone 14**. 

- The reason why we see a negative reaction of the stock is because the phone had mixed opinions.
- The phone **had a button** (some people liked it, some didn't, especially after the iPhone X), the phone had no **face ID**,
the phone was much **cheaper** than their flagships.
- iPhone 13 was looked at as a **better option** than the IPhone SE 3 and iPhone 14
- Jumping to **Aug-Sep**, **IPhone 14** was announced in **August** and was launched in **September**. We see a good increase in the stock volume during the month of August

## **But why the volume drop during October**
- Apple had to cut back production of **IPhone 14** and **IPhone 14 Plus** models due to **weaker demand**
- Raised **doubts** about Apple's product strategy
- Moreover, there were economic conditions like **inflation, recession fears and global uncertainties**

The **closing share price** in 2021 was higher than compared to 2022.

## **Why is that the case?**
- The IPhone 13 was widely **more popular** than the newer models - IPhone 14 and IPhone 15
- Even **in 2025**, IPhone 13 has a **market share of 16.03%**, that's pretty good for an older IPhone
- **IPhone 14** was a **dissappointment** overall, only the flagship **Pro and Pro Max models** saw a **rise in sales** enough to compete with the IPhone 13
- As IPhone 13 went down in price as newer models released, fearing recession and global economic uncertanity, people saw IPhone 13 as a **value for money** phone

Appleâ€™s stock dipped on Mondays and Fridays, while mid-week days (especially Thursday) saw better average daily gains in 2022

## **Why?**
- Investors may react to news or events that occurred over the weekends. The more negative sentiment builds up, the more the stock reacts - either negatively or positively
- Some traders sell shares on Friday's to avoid exposure to weekend news risks
- Behavioral finance shows investors behave differently on specific weekdays based on risk tolerance, liquidity needs, and scheduled news releases
- Weekdays are more nuanced as investors behave more based on emotions, compared to an algorithm that exploits this

## **In my opinion, weekdays are the thriving days for an algorithm (might dive into this deeper in the future)**

Apple stock showed a massive closing price increase in 2021, but then dipped back in 2022

## **What might be the case?**
- One **plausible explanation** is the **release** of iPhone 13, Apple saw a very **positive response** from consumers
- Investors liked Apple's **product strategy** and started putting money
- In 2022, iPhone 14 released, didn't see much popularity. Prices dropped, maybe due to **market correction**?
